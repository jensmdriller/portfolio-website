A Bootstrap 4 based website hosting information about my professional experience, skills, and past projects. 

## Overview:
I wanted to create a website showcasing my skills, projects, and positions I've held. If my abilities match a position you have been looking to fill, feel free to reach out to me directly. I am always eager to learn about new opportunities in tech (software and/or hardware) or biotech.

After learning how to create simple websites using Bootstrap as a foundation, I migrated my portfolio website from wordpress onto a LAMP stack hosted on GCP. Feel free to explore the site itself or the code that makes up the website. 

## Features:
- Apache (LAMP) based architecture
- Hosted on Google's cloud platform. 
- Not currently dockerized but hey, might be fun to do in the near future. Then I could manage the deployment with kubernetes. How overkill is that!?
- Tons of cool projects
- Info about my jobs that's not protected by NDA or other legally binding agreements
