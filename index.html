              <div class="subheading mb-3">Moogsoft</div>
              <p>At Moogsoft, I leverage my background in automation and Linux system administration to deploy software solutions in the cloud. Using a combination of tools such as Terraform and Ansible, I deploy, configure, and manage computing infrastructure to run Moogsoft's core product, AiOps.</p>
              <p>In addition to managing the current infrastructure, I work on ways to make the products more cloud-native. From leveraging tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to integrating serverless products on the cloud, I actively look for ways to improve reliability and scalability, reduce costs, and employ security best practices.</p>
              <p>Further, as a member of the team providing the last line of support for the product, I employ industry-leading DevOps and SRE practices to ensure high availability and redundancy for the end-user. Whether it's responding to a SEV1 outage or trying to prevent the next one from occurring, I integrate the best-in-class monitoring and automation solutions into production environments.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">EpiBiome</div>
              <p>At EpiBiome, the core component of my job was working with research data. From building dashboards, developing a data warehouse, or building tools for data capture, almost every task revolved around data. </p>
              <p>One notable accomplishment while at EpiBiome was developing the company's cloud-based data warehouse. I consolidated data from multiple relational and NoSQL databases, websites, and the company's Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Once built, the data lake captured research and process data generated from the lab as well as customer and sales information from the company's customer-facing sequencing service.</p>
              <p>In addition to working on the data warehouse, I developed several Python and JavaScript-based tools for data input and validation, inventory and asset management, and internal dashboards and data visualizations. These tools vary from a simple Python script to a full stack website deployed using a python web framework. Ultimately, these tools coupled with the data warehouse help lead to scientific discoveries as well as serve as a tool to show current and potential investors the advancements taking place within the company.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Software Projects</h2>

            <h3>Data Warehouse</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Working for a biotech company dependent on research data generated by the scientists, it became vital to have a <b>centralized data store</b>. By consolidating relational and NoSQL databases into one location, the scientists could then analyze results and perform analytics on the data. Before long, this data warehouse made its way into every major lab process leading to greater discoveries and as a result, a higher valuation for the company as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Migration</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">You don't know how painfully bad AWS is until you have a project deployed on <b>Google's Cloud Platform (GCP)</b>. At least, that's how I felt after my first time developing on GCP. Before long, the developers at the company realized this too and made the executive decision to migrate all our services over. I was asked to lead this effort and in only 3 weeks, all essential services were operational on the Google Cloud. Other than some cold storage left on S3, we were fully operational on GCP and couldn't be happier. </p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>

            <p>This is really multiple projects combined into one, but hey, it's all kinda getting at the same point: I made some websites. Two worth mentioning are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An internal company website for reviewing research data and downloading results.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The content for this site was entirely generated from the data stored in the company's central data warehouse and constantly updated to ensure access to the latest results.</li>
                        <li><b>LAMP</b> stack deployment using the Apache web framework
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An e-commerce website to display genomic data built on the Django web framework.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site took orders &amp; payment, displayed results, and integrated with our newly implemented data warehouse</li>
                        <li>It is built on the <b>Django</b> web framework and utilizes common libraries such as Django-Oscar</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol><br>

            <h3>Web Apps - Google App Maker</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">To interface with our data warehouse, we needed a tool that was quick to build but customizable enough to suit our needs. Google App Maker is just the tool. I built <b>over 10 web apps</b> to view/record/analyze data, interact with our inventory system, receive and log incoming packages, and more.</p>

            <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">While at EpiBiome, I helped with the development and deployment of our tools for <b>processing sequencing data</b>. The tools were developed for deployment across cloud hosted compute instances and interfaced with cloud buckets/storage. The bioinformatics projects were a lot of fun because we got to develop with larger compute infrastructure and work with more advanced solutions/tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.</p>

            <h3>Renaming Utility - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/file-folder-management">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Who likes to rename hundreds of items manually? I know I definitely do not! Well if you don't like to either, I've got just the thing. I created a script to <b>rename a whole bunch of files at once</b>. Just make a map of the old and new names, run the script, and viola all your files are renamed.</p>

            <h3>Python User Select - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/python-user-select">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Are you tired of <b>validating user input</b> for those stop-gap scripts that accept command line input? Have you used other libraries to accomplish just this to find they don't work in Jupyter Notebooks? Well I have just the fix. See that link to the git repo? Okay great, follow that and you can find a variety of functions for user input and sanitization.</p>

            <h3>Nest Camera - API Alerts - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/nest-cam-api">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p>My family asked me for a tool to receive alerts if there was a lack of motion detected by a specific Nest Camera. I know right, 99% of people want to know when there is motion, not when there is not. The reason though was because my Grandma lives alone and the family was worried about the possibility of her falling down. Thus, if too much time went by without motion, the script <b>triggers an email alert</b> to a group of family members.</p>
            <p>Also, Nest, if y'all are reading this, I'd love it if you released an API SDK.</p><br>

            <h3>JupyterHub - Cloud Deployment Guide - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/jupyter-tools-notes">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p>I wanted to make a clear and concise <b>guide to deploying JupyterHub</b> on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). The guide walks through provisioning a server, installing all dependencies, and acquiring web certificates to encrypt web traffic (HTTPS/SSL). It's pretty cool! If I were you, I'd check it out...</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>I enjoy building everything from bicycles to computers. I can even take apart a chainsaw or wire the electrical in your house. Over the years, I have picked up an odd assortment of handyman skills such as welding, woodworking, machining, and plumbing. Heck, I've even lived on a farm in Hawaii... twice!</p>
          <p>I always have several projects going on outside of work. Luckily for my parent's sanity, I've moved away from go-karts and towards electronics. I have my own 3D printer, love to program Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's, and do a bit of web development and python coding as well.</p>
          <p>I'm not much for TV or video games, but I do enjoy the occasional flight simulator program or rocket launch on Kerbal Space Program. Who knew learning orbital mechanics could be so fun!?<p>
