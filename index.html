          <p class="mb-5">In June of 2016, I graduated from UC San Diego where I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a primary focus in semiconductor devices and materials. Through my coursework, I studied solid state physics, integrated circuit design, and embedded system design.</p>

          <p class="mb-5">During my studies, I held two electrical engineering internships. At the Department of Water Resources, I helped design the electrical and communications infrastructure surrounding the California Aqueduct. At Quantum Design, my work focused on the development and prototyping of new measurement techniques for studying the electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties of materials.</p>

          <p class="mb-5">While studying at UC San Diego, I worked as a Research Assistant in a physics laboratory. In the time I was at the lab, I worked on projects in materials characterization, integrated circuit testing, cryogenic filtering, and electrical device measurements.</p>

          <p class="mb-5">After graduating, I moved to the Bay Area to work as a Process Engineer at EpiBiome. From process development to data analysis, I engineer the tools necessary for the scientists' daily operations. Most of my work is centered around process development as well as the development and integration of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).</p>

          <p class="mb-5">Having worked in engineering offices, research labs, and at a biotech start-up, I bring to the table a diverse background of science and engineering. I thrive in fast-paced environments and embrace the opportunity to take on challenging projects.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">EpiBiome</div>
              <p>My work at EpiBiome consists primarily of engineering processes for the laboratory. I oversee the implementation of several projects going on in the lab and help design the process flow necessary to optimize efficiency and scalability. To aid in the process development, I integrate custom hardware and software to better achieve our production goals. On the hardware side, I've integrated raspberry pis, custom sensors, 3D prints and more. On the software, I have developed custom Python scripts for data entry, automation, and database operations.

In addition to process development, I work extensively on the development and integration of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for storing and querying company data. I collaborate with the bioinformaticians and data scientists to store data in a matter suitable for future discoveries. Additionally, through RESTful APIs, I have configured several websites to communicate directly with the LIMS to store data from customer orders, laboratory operations, inventory management, etc.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Software Projects</h2>

            <h3>Data Warehouse - [Project Details](#data-warehouse)</h3>
            <p>Working for a biotech company dependent on research data generated by the scientists, it became vital to have a centralized data store. By consolidating relational and NoSQL databases into one location, the scientists could then analyze results and preform analytics on the data. Before long, this data warehouse made it's way into every major lab process leading to greater discoveries and as a result, high valuation for the company as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Migration</h3>
            <p>You don't know how painfully bad AWS is until you have a project deployed on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). At least, that's how I felt after my first time developing on GCP. Before long, the developers at the company realized this too and made the executive decision to migrate all our services over. I was asked to lead this effort and in only 3 weeks, all essential services were opeational on Google Cloud. Other than some cold storage left on S3, we were fully operational on GCP and couldn't be happier. </p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>

            <p>This is really multiple projects combined into one, but hey, it's all kinda getting at the same point: I made some websites. Two worth mentioning are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An internal company website for reviewing research data and downloading results.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The content for this site was entirely generated from the data stored in the company's central data warehouse and constantly updated to ensure access to the latest results.</li>
                        <li>LAMP stack deployment using the Apache web framework
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I took over ownership of our customer facing e-commerence website.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site took orders &amp; payment, displayed results, and integrated with our newly implemented data warehouse</li>
                        <li>This site is built on the Django web framework and utilizes common libraries such as Django-Oscar</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Web Apps Via Google App Maker</h3>
            <p>To interface with our data warehouse, we needed a tool that was quick to build but customizable enough to suit our needs. Google App Maker is just the tool. I probably built over 10 web apps to view/record/analyze data, interract with our inventory system, recieve and log incomming packages, and more. </p>

            <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p>While at EpiBiome, I helped with the development and deployment of our tools for processing sequencing data. The tools were developed for deployment across cloud hosted compute instances and interfaced with cloud buckets/storage. The bioinformatics projects were a lot of fun because we got to develop with larger compute infrastructure and work with more advanced solutions/tools such as Docker and Kubernetes. </p>

            <h3>Renaming Utility - [git repo](#git-rename)</h3>
            <p>Who likes to rename hundreds of items manually? I know I definitely do not! Well if you don't like to either, I've got just the thing. I created a script to rename a whole bunch of files at once. Just make a map of the old and new names, run the script, and viola all your files are renamed.</p>

            <h3>Python User Select - [git repo](#git-rename)</h3>
            <p>Are you tired of validing user input for those stop-gap scripts that accept command line input? Have you used other libraries to accomplish just this to find they don't work in Jupyter Notebooks? Well I have just the fix. See that link to the git repo? Okay great, follow that and you can find a variety of functions for user input and sanitization. </p>

            <h3>Nest Camera - API Alerts - [git repo](#git-rename)</h3>
            <p>My family wanted a tool to recieve alerts if there was a lack of motion detected by a specific Nest Camera. I know right, 99% of people want to know when there **is** motion, not when there is **not**. The reason though was because my Grandma lives alone and the family was worried about the possiblity of her falling down. Thus, if too much time went by without motion, the script triggers an email alert to a group of family members.</p>
            <p>Also, Nest, if y'all are reading this, you need to release an API SDK. </p>

            <h3>JupyterHub - Cloud Deployment Guide - [git repo](#git-rename)</h3>
            <p>I wanted to make a clear and concise guide to deploying JupyterHub on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). The guide walks through provisioning a server, installing all dependencies, and acquiring web certificates to encrypt web traffic (HTTPS/SSL). It's pretty cool! If I were you, I'd check it out...</p>
