            <p>Hello All,</p>
            <p>I'm 25, currently living in the Bay Area, and have a background in hardware design and software development.<p>
          <p>I currently hold a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC San Diego. If you look at my background, I think it is safe to say that I've taken a winding road to get where I am today. I've held positions in hardware development, cryogenics, condensed matter physics, and most recently, process engineering.
          <!--<p>Having been in the startup space for over a year now, I love how fast things move. I've even implemented a sudo-startup of my own for managing my personal projects. I look forward to working in this environment or in larger companies that employ a similar mindset</p>-->
          <p>The positions I've held coupled with my educational background have led me to develop a variety of technical skills. For example, I can design circuit boards, 3D model with Solidworks, or set-up a centralized data store to house company data. To get a better idea of my skills and experience, feel free to check out the relevant sections below.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">EpiBiome</div>
              <p>My work at EpiBiome consists primarily of engineering processes for the laboratory. I oversee the implementation of several projects going on in the lab and help design the process flow necessary to optimize efficiency and scalability.</p>
                <p>To aid in the process development, I integrate <b>custom hardware and software</b> to better achieve our production goals. On the hardware side, I've integrated raspberry pis, custom sensors, 3D prints and more. On the software, I have developed custom Python scripts for data entry, automation, and database operations.<p>

              <p>In addition to process development, I work extensively on the development and integration of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for storing and querying company data (also commonly referred to as a <b>Data Warehouse</b>). I collaborate with the bioinformaticians and data scientists to store data in a matter suitable for future discoveries. Additionally, through RESTful APIs, I have configured several websites to communicate directly with the LIMS to store data from customer orders, laboratory operations, inventory management, etc.</p>
                <p>In addition to being a Process Engineer, I am also the <b>Product Manager</b> for EpiPhany, EpiBiome's customer facing bacterial sequencing service. In this role, I direct the operations, R&amp;D and business logistics efforts for the service.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Software Projects</h2>

            <h3>Data Warehouse</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Working for a biotech company dependent on research data generated by the scientists, it became vital to have a <b>centralized data store</b>. By consolidating relational and NoSQL databases into one location, the scientists could then analyze results and perform analytics on the data. Before long, this data warehouse made its way into every major lab process leading to greater discoveries and as a result, a higher valuation for the company as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Migration</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">You don't know how painfully bad AWS is until you have a project deployed on <b>Google's Cloud Platform (GCP)</b>. At least, that's how I felt after my first time developing on GCP. Before long, the developers at the company realized this too and made the executive decision to migrate all our services over. I was asked to lead this effort and in only 3 weeks, all essential services were operational on the Google Cloud. Other than some cold storage left on S3, we were fully operational on GCP and couldn't be happier. </p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>

            <p>This is really multiple projects combined into one, but hey, it's all kinda getting at the same point: I made some websites. Two worth mentioning are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An internal company website for reviewing research data and downloading results.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The content for this site was entirely generated from the data stored in the company's central data warehouse and constantly updated to ensure access to the latest results.</li>
                        <li><b>LAMP</b> stack deployment using the Apache web framework
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I took over ownership of our customer facing e-commerce website.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site took orders &amp; payment, displayed results, and integrated with our newly implemented data warehouse</li>
                        <li>This site is built on the <b>Django</b> web framework and utilizes common libraries such as Django-Oscar</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol><br>

            <h3>Web Apps - Google App Maker</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">To interface with our data warehouse, we needed a tool that was quick to build but customizable enough to suit our needs. Google App Maker is just the tool. I probably built <b>over 10 web apps</b> to view/record/analyze data, interact with our inventory system, receive and log incoming packages, and more.</p>

            <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">While at EpiBiome, I helped with the development and deployment of our tools for <b>processing sequencing data</b>. The tools were developed for deployment across cloud hosted compute instances and interfaced with cloud buckets/storage. The bioinformatics projects were a lot of fun because we got to develop with larger compute infrastructure and work with more advanced solutions/tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.</p>

            <h3>Renaming Utility - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/file-folder-management">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Who likes to rename hundreds of items manually? I know I definitely do not! Well if you don't like to either, I've got just the thing. I created a script to <b>rename a whole bunch of files at once</b>. Just make a map of the old and new names, run the script, and viola all your files are renamed.</p>

            <h3>Python User Select - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/python-user-select">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Are you tired of <b>validating user input</b> for those stop-gap scripts that accept command line input? Have you used other libraries to accomplish just this to find they don't work in Jupyter Notebooks? Well I have just the fix. See that link to the git repo? Okay great, follow that and you can find a variety of functions for user input and sanitization.</p>

            <h3>Nest Camera - API Alerts - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/nest-cam-api">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p>My family asked me for a tool to receive alerts if there was a lack of motion detected by a specific Nest Camera. I know right, 99% of people want to know when there is motion, not when there is not. The reason though was because my Grandma lives alone and the family was worried about the possibility of her falling down. Thus, if too much time went by without motion, the script <b>triggers an email alert</b> to a group of family members.</p>
            <p>Also, Nest, if y'all are reading this, I'd love it if you released an API SDK.</p><br>

            <h3>JupyterHub - Cloud Deployment Guide - <a href="https://github.com/jensmdriller/utility-scripts/tree/master/jupyter-tools-notes">GitHub</a></h3>
            <p>I wanted to make a clear and concise <b>guide to deploying JupyterHub</b> on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). The guide walks through provisioning a server, installing all dependencies, and acquiring web certificates to encrypt web traffic (HTTPS/SSL). It's pretty cool! If I were you, I'd check it out...</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>I enjoy building everything from bicycles to computers. I can even take apart a chainsaw or wire the electrical in your house. Over the years, I have picked up an odd assortment of handyman skills such as welding, woodworking, machining, and plumbing. Heck, I've even lived on a farm in Hawaii... twice!</p>
          <p>I always have several projects going on outside of work. Luckily for my parent's sanity, I've moved away from go-karts and towards electronics. I have my own 3D printer, love to program Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's, and do a bit of web development and python coding as well.</p>
          <p>I'm not much for TV or video games, but I do enjoy the occasional flight simulator program or rocket launch on Kerbal Space Program. Who knew learning orbital mechanics could be so fun!?<p>
